# Online Equation Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics for Robotics Manipulator Using Recursive Least Squares

This project involves the identification of dynamic equations for a robotics manipulator using Recursive Least Squares with nonlinear functions. The approach is designed to handle online data and can effectively model the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Run the Dataset**  
   Load and run `dataset.mat` to initialize the data required for the process.

2. **Run the Library**  
   Execute either `Linear.m` or `non_lib.mat` depending on the specific library you want to use for the nonlinear transformation.

3. **Run the Main File**  
   Open and run `main.m` to start the online equation discovery process.
